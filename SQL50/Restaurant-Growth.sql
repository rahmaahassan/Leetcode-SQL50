(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).
Write an SQL query to compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
Return result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.
